  "passage": "The bird flew high into the sky, soaring above the clouds. It was a sunny day, and the bird enjoyed the warm breeze as it glided over the mountains and rivers. Below, the forest stretched for miles, filled with trees and animals. The bird looked down and spotted a nest it had built in the tallest tree in the forest. After a long journey, the bird decided to return to its home, bringing food for its chicks.",
